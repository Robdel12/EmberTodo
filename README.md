# Ember TodoMVC
Nothing fancy besides two additions:
- Firebase to sync across devices.
- Silly little "You don't have any active todos" message
- Added tests

## TODO:
- Maybe multi user?
- Make tests less fragile. Like a build and teardown method or helper. Tests are currently dependent on run order.
